### Rules

- Given a number, return the number as a string unless one of the following occurs:
- The number is divisible by 3. Then you should return the string "fizz"
- The number is divisible by 5, in which case you should return the string "buzz"
- Only account for natural numbers, no negative numbers


### Extra challenges

- Change the code so that "fizz" is returned if the input number is divisible by 7 rather than 3
- Change the code so that the string values returned can be changed
